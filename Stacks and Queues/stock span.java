/*The stock span problem is a financial problem where we have a series of N daily price quotes for a stock and we need to calculate span of stockâ€™s price for all N days. You are given an array of length N, where ith element of array denotes the price of a stock on ith. Find the span of stock's price on ith day, for every 1<=i<=N.
A span of a stock's price on a given day, i, is the maximum number of consecutive days before the (i+1)th day, for which stock's price on these days is less than or equal to that on the ith day.

Input Format:
Enter the size of the array N and add N more numbers and store in the array.

Explanation:
For the given case
for day1 stock span =1 for day2 stock span =2 (as 35>30 so both days are included in it) for day3 stock span =3 (as 40>35 so 2+1=3) for day4 stock span =1 (as 38<40 so only that day is included) for day5 stock span =1 (as 35<38 so only that day is included) hence output is 1 2 3 1 1 END
